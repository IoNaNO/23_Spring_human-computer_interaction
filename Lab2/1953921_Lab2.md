## 1 Requirements

As a user interface of an image search system, our primary requirement should be user-friendly and efficient for users to interact with information. We can analyze the requirements based on the Five-stage framework taught by Pro. Shen in class.

1. Formulation
2. Initiation of action
3. Review of results
4. Refinement
5. Use

Five-stages can be repeated until users' needs are met. If users' are unsatisfied with the results, they should be able to have additional options and change their queries easily.

By incorporating the Five-stage framework with our image search system, we can refine and clearify our requirements.

1. Formulation
   - It contains an input box to upload an image
   - Users can preview the query image in the searching window
   - **Users can change the input image**
   - **Users can change to dark mode**
2. Initiation of action
   - It has a search button 
3. Review of results
   - Provide the total number of results
   - **Users can click on search result previews to view raw images**
4. Refinement
   - Allow changing search parameters, we choose images' tag as parameter. Users can choose different tag to filter the search result
5. Use
   - Users can add selected images to favorite list
   - **Users can review favorite list**

## 2 Implements

To better achieve the above requirements, I used Vue3 front-end framework for the design and implementation of the user interface. I chose element-plus as the components lib. I will showcase the user inferface by combining its functionality with the Five-stage framework. 

### Before Search
